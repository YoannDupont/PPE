   An electric food processor

   A food processor is a kitchen appliance used to facilitate repetitive
   tasks in the preparation of food. Today, the term almost always refers
   to an electric-motor-driven appliance, although there are some manual
   devices also referred to as "food processors".

   Food processors are similar to blenders in many forms. A food processor
   typically requires little to no liquid during use, and even its finely
   chopped products retain some texture. A blender, however, requires a
   set amount of liquid in order for the blade to properly blend the food,
   and its output is also more liquidy.^[1] Food processors are used to
   blend, chop, dice, and slice, allowing for quicker meal
   preparation.^[2]

History[edit]

   One of the first electric food processors was the Starmix, introduced
   by German company Electrostar in 1946.^[3]^[4] Although the basic unit
   resembled a simple blender, numerous accessories were available,
   including attachments for slicing bread, milk centrifuges and ice cream
   bowls.^[5]^[6]^[7] In a time when electric motors were expensive, they
   also developed the piccolo, where the food processor's base unit could
   drive a vacuum cleaner. In the 1960s, Albrecht von Goertz designed the
   Starmix MX3 food processor.^[8]^[9] Although the entire company was
   rebranded as Starmix in 1968 following the success of the processors,
   they later focused on vacuum cleaners and electric hand-dryers and the
   last mixer was produced around the year 2000. In France, the concept of
   a machine to process food began when a catering company salesman,
   Pierre Verdun, observed the large amount of time his clients spent in
   the kitchen chopping, shredding and mixing. He produced a simple but
   effective solution, a bowl with a revolving blade in the base. In 1960,
   this evolved into Robot-Coupe, a company established to manufacture
   commercial "food processors" for the catering industry. In the late
   1960s, a commercial food processor driven by a powerful commercial
   induction motor was produced. Robot-Coupe's Magimix food processor
   arrived from France in the UK in 1974, beginning with the Model 1800.
   Then, a UK company Kenwood Limited started their own first Kenwood Food
   Processor, 'processor de- luxe,' in 1979.^[10]

   Carl Sontheimer introduced this same Magimix 1800 food processor to
   North America in 1973 under the Cuisinart brand, as America's first
   domestic food processor. Sontheimer contracted with a Japanese
   manufacturer to produce new models in 1977 in order to immediately
   launch his new Japanese-made food processor in 1980 when his contract
   with Robot-Coupe expired.

Marc Harrison's Cuisinart Re-design[edit]

   Disability research was an ongoing project because the first food
   processor created was not user friendly for all individuals. In 1978,
   Marc Harrison was a professor at the Rhode Island School of
   Design.^[11] He specialized in Industrial Design. Cuisinart, an
   American company, contacted and hired Harrison in 1978 to update the
   Food Processor.^[12] Harrison updated the product to focus on making
   the machine usable for those with limited abilities with fine motor
   skills and eyesight, which in turn made it easier for any user to
   operate. These updates included larger writing on the base of the
   product to benefit those who have vision impairments, and larger
   handles and buttons.^[12] These updates were created so that the food
   processor could be accessible for all users.

Functions[edit]

   Food processors normally have multiple functions, depending on the
   placement and type of attachment or blade.^[13]^[14] Some of the more
   challenging tasks include kneading stiff doughs, chopping raw carrots,
   and shredding a hard cheese, which may require a more powerful
   motor.^[15] Accessories such as blender and juicer attachments may
   allow a food processor to perform the duties of other appliances.^[16]

Design and operation[edit]

   The base of the unit houses a motor which turns a vertical shaft. A
   bowl, usually made of transparent plastic, fits around the shaft.
   Cutting blades can be attached to the shaft; these fit so as to operate
   near the bottom of the bowl. Shredding or slicing disks can be attached
   instead; these spin near the top of the bowl. A lid with a "feed tube"
   is then fitted onto the bowl.

   The feed tube allows ingredients to be added while chopping or slicing.
   It also serves as a chute through which items are introduced to
   shredding or slicing disks. A "pusher" is provided, sized to slide
   through the feed tube, protecting the user's fingers.

   Almost all modern food processors have safety devices which prevent the
   motor from operating if the bowl is not properly secured to the base or
   if the lid is not properly secured to the bowl.

Variations[edit]

   A food chopper is basically a food processor of a smaller size. It is
   also better suited for chopping food than making smoothies.^[17]

   An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot, is a software
   application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet,
   usually with the intent to imitate human activity on the Internet, such
   as messaging, on a large scale.^[1] An Internet bot plays the client
   role in a client–server model whereas the server role is usually played
   by web servers. Internet bots are able to perform tasks, that are
   simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could ever do. The
   most extensive use of bots is for web crawling, in which an automated
   script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More
   than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.^[2]

   Efforts by web servers to restrict bots vary. Some servers have a
   robots.txt file that contains the rules governing bot behavior on that
   server. Any bot that does not follow the rules could, in theory, be
   denied access to or removed from the affected website. If the posted
   text file has no associated program/software/app, then adhering to the
   rules is entirely voluntary. There would be no way to enforce the rules
   or to ensure that a bot's creator or implementer reads or acknowledges
   the robots.txt file. Some bots are "good" – e.g. search engine spiders
   – while others are used to launch malicious attacks on, for example,
   political campaigns.^[2]

IM and IRC[edit]

   Some bots communicate with users of Internet-based services, via
   instant messaging (IM), Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or other web
   interfaces such as Facebook bots and Twitter bots. These chatbots may
   allow people to ask questions in plain English and then formulate a
   response. Such bots can often handle reporting weather, zip code
   information, sports scores, currency or other unit conversions,
   etc.^[3] Others are used for entertainment, such as SmarterChild on AOL
   Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.^[citation needed]
   Bots are very commonly used on social media. A user may not be aware
   that they are interacting with a bot.

   Additional roles of an IRC bot may be to listen on a conversation
   channel, and to comment on certain phrases uttered by the participants
   (based on pattern matching). This is sometimes used as a help service
   for new users or to censor profanity.^[citation needed]

Social bots[edit]

   Main article: Social bot

   Social networking bots are sets of algorithms that take on the duties
   of repetitive sets of instructions in order to establish a service or
   connection among social networking users. Among the various designs of
   networking bots, the most common are chat bots, algorithms designed to
   converse with a human user, and social bots, algorithms designed to
   mimic human behaviors to converse with patterns similar to those of a
   human user. The history of social botting can be traced back to Alan
   Turing in the 1950s and his vision of designing sets of instructional
   code approved by the Turing test. In the 1960s Joseph Weizenbaum
   created ELIZA, a natural language processing computer program.
   considered an early indicator of artificial intelligence algorithms.
   ELIZA inspired computer programmers to design tasked programs that can
   match behavior patterns to their sets of instruction. As a result,
   natural language processing has become an influencing factor to the
   development of artificial intelligence and social bots. And as
   information and thought see a progressive mass spreading on social
   media websites,^[4] innovative technological advancements are made
   following the same pattern.^[citation needed]

   Reports of political interferences in recent elections, including the
   2016 US and 2017 UK general elections,^[5] have set the notion of bots
   being more prevalent because of the ethics that is challenged between
   the bot's design and the bot's designer. Emilio Ferrara, a computer
   scientist from the University of Southern California reporting on
   Communications of the ACM,^[6] said the lack of resources available to
   implement fact-checking and information verification results in the
   large volumes of false reports and claims made about these bots on
   social media platforms. In the case of Twitter, most of these bots are
   programmed with search filter capabilities that target keywords and
   phrases favoring political agendas and then retweet them. While the
   attention of bots is programmed to spread unverified information
   throughout the social media platforms,^[7] it is a challenge that
   programmers face in the wake of a hostile political climate. The Bot
   Effect is what Ferrera reported as the socialization of bots and human
   users creating a vulnerability to the leaking of personal information
   and polarizing influences outside the ethics of the bot's code, and was
   confirmed by Guillory Kramer in his study where he observed the
   behavior of emotionally volatile users and the impact the bots have on
   them, altering their perception of reality.^[citation needed]

Commercial bots[edit]

   There has been a great deal of controversy about the use of bots in an
   automated trading function. Auction website eBay took legal action in
   an attempt to suppress a third-party company from using bots to look
   for bargains on its site; this approach backfired on eBay and attracted
   the attention of further bots. The United Kingdom-based bet exchange,
   Betfair, saw such a large amount of traffic coming from bots that it
   launched a WebService API aimed at bot programmers, through which it
   can actively manage bot interactions.^[citation needed]

   Bot farms are known to be used in online app stores, like the Apple App
   Store and Google Play, to manipulate positions^[8] or increase positive
   ratings/reviews.^[9]

   A rapidly growing, benign form of internet bot is the chatbot. From
   2016, when Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on
   their platform, there has been an exponential growth of their use on
   that app alone. 30,000 bots were created for Messenger in the first six
   months, rising to 100,000 by September 2017.^[10] Avi Ben Ezra, CTO of
   SnatchBot, told Forbes that evidence from the use of their chatbot
   building platform pointed to a near future saving of millions of hours
   of human labor as 'live chat' on websites was replaced with bots.^[11]

   Companies use internet bots to increase online engagement and
   streamline communication. Companies often use bots to cut down on cost;
   instead of employing people to communicate with consumers, companies
   have developed new ways to be efficient. These chatbots are used to
   answer customers' questions: for example, Domino's developed a chatbot
   that can take orders via Facebook Messenger. Chatbots allow companies
   to allocate their employees' time to other tasks.^[12]

Malicious bots[edit]

   One example of the malicious use of bots is the coordination and
   operation of an automated attack on networked computers, such as a
   denial-of-service attack by a botnet. Internet bots or web bots can
   also be used to commit click fraud and more recently have appeared
   around MMORPG games as computer game bots. Another category is
   represented by spambots, internet bots that attempt to spam large
   amounts of content on the Internet, usually adding advertising links.
   More than 94.2% of websites have experienced a bot attack.^[2]

   There are malicious bots (and botnets) of the following types:
    1. Spambots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook
       pages
    2. Downloaded programs that suck bandwidth by downloading entire
       websites
    3. Website scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it
       without permission on automatically generated doorway pages
    4. Registration bots that sign up a specific email address to numerous
       services in order to have the confirmation messages flood the email
       inbox and distract from important messages indicating a security
       breach.^[13]
    5. Viruses and worms
    6. DDoS attacks
    7. Botnets, zombie computers, etc.
    8. Spambots that try to redirect people onto a malicious website,
       sometimes found in comment sections or forums of various websites
    9. Viewbots create fake views^[14]^[15]
   10. Bots that buy up higher-demand seats for concerts, particularly by
       ticket brokers who resell the tickets.^[16] These bots run through
       the purchase process of entertainment event-ticketing sites and
       obtain better seats by pulling as many seats back as it can.
   11. Bots that are used in massively multiplayer online role-playing
       games to farm for resources that would otherwise take significant
       time or effort to obtain, which can be a concern for online in-game
       economies.^[17]
   12. Bots that increase views for YouTube videos
   13. Bots that increase traffic counts on analytics reporting to extract
       money from advertisers. A study by Comscore found that over half of
       ads shown across thousands of campaigns between May 2012 and
       February 2013 were not served to human users.^[18]
   14. Bots used on internet forums to automatically post inflammatory or
       nonsensical posts to disrupt the forum and anger users.

   in 2012, journalist Percy von Lipinski reported that he discovered
   millions of bots or botted or pinged views at CNN iReport. CNN iReport
   quietly removed millions of views from the account of iReporter Chris
   Morrow.^[19] It is not known if the ad revenue received by CNN from the
   fake views was ever returned to the advertisers.^[citation needed]

   The most widely used anti-bot technique is the use of CAPTCHA. Examples
   of providers include Recaptcha, Minteye, Solve Media and NuCaptcha.
   However, captchas are not foolproof in preventing bots, as they can
   often be circumvented by computer character recognition, security
   holes, and outsourcing captcha solving to cheap laborers.^[citation

Human interaction with social bots[edit]

   There are two main concerns with bots: clarity and face-to-face
   support. The cultural background of human beings affects the way they
   communicate with social bots.^[citation needed]

   Many people believe that bots are vastly less intelligent than humans
   and so they are not worthy of our respect.^[1]

   Min-Sun Kim proposed five concerns or issues that may arise when
   communicating with a social robot, and they are avoiding the damage of
   peoples' feelings, minimizing impositions, disapproval from others,
   clarity issues, and how effective their messages may come across.^[1]

   People who oppose social robots argue that they also take away from the
   genuine creations of human relationships.^[1]
